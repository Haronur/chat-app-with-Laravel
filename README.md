Example :

$ php artisan vendor:publish --tag=chatify-config
```
* NOTE: Publishing assets means (e.g. config) that creating a copy of the package's config file into the `config` folder of your Laravel applications and like so with the other asstes (Package's Views, controllers, migrations ...). 

#### 4. Migrations
Migrate the new `migrations` that added by the previous step 
```sh
$ php artisan migrate
```
#### 5. Storage Symlink
Create a shourtcut or a symlink to the `storage` folder into the `public` folder
```sh
$ php artisan storage:link

/*
* Package Service Providers...
*/
\Chatify\ChatifyServiceProvider::class,
...
```

and the following alias into  into `config/app.php` aliases:
```php
...
/*
* Class Aliases
*/
'Chatify' => Chatify\Facades\ChatifyMessenger::class,
...
```

 * After installing the package, you can access the messeneger by the default path(route path) which is `/chatify`, and you can change path name in the config file `config/chatify.php` as mentioned in the `configurations` below.

### I have integrated this package in laravel 8 . But after following the above instruction I had to do extra two things is below:
- 1) copy CSS & js folder from ```vendor\munafio\chatify\assets ``` and paste to the public folder in the root of my app and 
- 2) As per laravel 8, I had to change
 `use App\Models\User;` to `use App\Models\User;`
 in the `MessagesController.php` file in the folder of```vendor\munafio\chatify\src\Http\Controllers``` 

###  Now it is working like laravel 6 version.
